# NTS Workout App

At its very simplest the main goal of project NTS is to provide a website and/or app that will help people track their workout routine. Ease of use is the theme of the project. It is our hope that the ease and accessibility of the project will aid in the promotion of self accountability and motivation by taking out the job of manually tracking your routine with excel or a similar tool.
